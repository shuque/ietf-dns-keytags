                   Collision Free Keytags for DNSSEC
                      draft-huque-dnsop-keytags-00

Abstract

   DNSSEC employs a Key Tag field in the RRSIG and DS resource records
   in order to efficiently identify the key that produced a DNSSEC
   signature and the key that should be used as secure entry point into
   a delegated zone.  The Key Tag was not intended to be a unique
   identifier.  Key tag collisions can occur in practice for keys in the
   same zone, though they are relatively rare in normal operation.
   Colliding key tags impose additional work on a validating resolver,
   which then has to check signatures for each of the candidate set of
   keys identified by the Key Tag.  Furthermore, they open up resolvers
   to computational denial of service attacks by adversaries deploying
   specially crafted zones with many intentionally colliding key tags.
   This document specifies updates to the DNSSEC protocol and the
   process of key generation to avoid colliding keys and enforce the
   uniqueness of key tags.

1.  Introduction

   DNSSEC [RFC4033] [RFC4034] [RFC4035] employs a Key Tag field in the
   RRSIG and DS resource records in order to efficiently identify the
   key that produced a DNSSEC signature the key that should be used as
   secure entry point into a delegated zone.  The Key Tag was not
   intended to be a unique identifier.  Key tag collisions can occur in
   practice for keys in the same zone, though they are relatively rare
   in normal operation.  Colliding key tags impose additional work on a
   validating resolver, which then has to check signatures for each of
   the candidate set of keys identified by the Key Tag.  Furthermore,
   they open up resolvers to computational denial of service attacks by
   adversaries deploying specially crafted zones with many intentionally
   colliding key tags [KEYTRAP].  This document specifies updates to the
   DNSSEC protocol and the process of key generation to avoid colliding

   keys and enforce the uniqueness of key tags.

2.  Protocol Behavior

   *  New DNSKEY algorithms MUST have DNSKEY RRsets that do not have
      colliding key tags

   *  What about existing algorithms?  Should we have new aliases for
      existing algorithms that allow us to incorporate the non collision
      requirement?

   *  Can we propose a future flag date after which existing algorithms
      will be required to enforce this requirement?

   *  Outline the general process by which key generation software
      should ensure uniqueness of keytags.

   *  Special considerations for multi-signer [RFC8901] configurations,
      where multiple distinct parties generate their own keys for the
      same zone (i) partition the keytag space between each signer/
      provider, and have each provider re-generate keys if necessary
      until they obtain one whose keytag is contained in their partition
      (ii) Use a central key broker to enforce keytag uniqueness, (iii)
      each signer when generating new keys, queries all DNSKEYs in the
      multi-signer group to avoid colliding keys.  To avoid race
      conditions, ideally the providers should not generate keys at the
      same time, and plausibly the zone owner could enforce non-
      conflicting key generation schedules across the multi-signer
      group.

   *  Describe what to do when a validator encounters a zone with both
      old and new DNSKEY algorithm numbers.

   *  For possible discussion: recommend the use DNS cookies to avoid
      offpath computational DoS attacks.
